## Project Description
This repository contains an AdaBoostClassifier model tailored for vehicle insurance fraud detection, achieving an accuracy of 89%. The unique aspect of this project is the integration of advanced evaluation techniques, which enhances the understanding of the model's performance in a comprehensive manner.

## Key Features
  
- **Enhanced Model Evaluation:** Utilization of traditional metrics complemented with a Confusion Matrix for a detailed analysis of errors and misclassifications.
  
- **Precision-Recall Curve Analysis:** Incorporation of Precision-Recall Curve plotting to evaluate the model's effectiveness in managing class imbalances, a critical aspect of fraud detection.
  
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Detailed analysis of feature importances to shed light on the factors driving the model's predictions.
  
- **Comprehensive Approach:** A blend of technical accuracy and practical interpretability, positioning this solution as both unique and creative within the domain of fraud detection.

## Project Impact
This project exemplifies how standard machine learning models can be enhanced with thoughtful evaluation methods. It serves as a valuable reference for educational and professional applications in fraud detection, demonstrating a balance between technical rigor and practical application.
